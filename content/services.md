    content: |
      At NVision IT, we understand organizations’ desire to transform their business processes, re-prioritize tasks, and potentially change the way they work for their business to grow. In order to succeed, many organizations are using Business Process Reengineering to maintain effectiveness, stabilize performance issues and achieve significant improvements in overall organizational performance. We believe there is a need for constant change in business process models so that they are aligned with current business trends and allow for facilitation of fundamental transformations in organizations.Business Process Reengineering is a business strategy used to optimize profits and keep organizations up to date. It transforms all processes of the business, enabling growth and making the organization more cost-effective and time-efficient. Existing business processes are reviewed with new rules established and implemented as a part of reengineering. This enables our reengineering consultants to prepare a plan to modify existing processes and blend them in with the new business rules. We review the existing strategy and suggest new methodologies to improve the business processes and operational effectiveness. Once objectives are established, the team best suited to achieve the desired results will be identified. After a brainstorming session where the attributes of the new business processes are analyzed, a new business model is created. The client (along with our team) implements the plan that their organization will follow to achieve optimum performance. The quality of our product is reflected in our commitment and professionalism toward the advancement and success of our clients. Some of our technical expertise includes customizing Oracle Application processes to fit the unique needs of our clients in workflow customizations, Oracle Application Framework (OAF), custom forms, and PL/SQL procedures.

      The desire for personalized applications that clients can term “My Application” is in high demand. Finding a solution that completely satisfies all requirements is almost nonexistent. Therefore, one has to build the application based on client-specific requirements. Custom Application Development allows solutions to be created based on client’s requirements, objectives and ideas. This complex process requires in-depth expertise in both development technologies and business processes. NVision IT has a technology-centric, enthusiastic and dedicated team who take a special interest in understanding clients’ requirements and objectives to fulfill the defined custom application development needs. Our methodology includes interacting with clients so that we understand their needs and develop an application solution together. We achieve this by coordinating and cooperating with our clients in every step of the process, resulting in a mutually beneficial relationship.  NVision IT follows a System Development Life Cycle approach for custom application development. Gathering requirements and analyzing the details helps our team visualize the outline of the application. This process and information helps in planning future phases of application development. Recording the collected data and sharing it with active team members enables a greater understanding of the application. Our system architecture experts prepare the required detailed diagrams, flow charts, etc., to facilitate application development and our experienced developers create the application during the design phase. Our subject matter experts oversee the entire process until development is completed. One of the final steps in the development process is to perform unit and integration testing to make sure the product meets the requirements and is bug free.   Some of our technical expertise includes customizing Oracle Application processes to fit the unique needs of our clients in workflow customizations, Oracle Application Framework (OAF), custom forms, and PL/SQL procedures.
