      The desire for personalized applications that clients can term “My Application” is in high demand. Finding a solution that completely satisfies all requirements is almost nonexistent. Therefore, one has to build the application based on client-specific requirements. Custom Application Development allows solutions to be created based on client’s requirements, objectives and ideas. This complex process requires in-depth expertise in both development technologies and business processes. NVision IT has a technology-centric, enthusiastic and dedicated team who take a special interest in understanding clients’ requirements and objectives to fulfill the defined custom application development needs. Our methodology includes interacting with clients so that we understand their needs and develop an application solution together. We achieve this by coordinating and cooperating with our clients in every step of the process, resulting in a mutually beneficial relationship.  NVision IT follows a System Development Life Cycle approach for custom application development. Gathering requirements and analyzing the details helps our team visualize the outline of the application. This process and information helps in planning future phases of application development. Recording the collected data and sharing it with active team members enables a greater understanding of the application. Our system architecture experts prepare the required detailed diagrams, flow charts, etc., to facilitate application development and our experienced developers create the application during the design phase. Our subject matter experts oversee the entire process until development is completed. One of the final steps in the development process is to perform unit and integration testing to make sure the product meets the requirements and is bug free.   Some of our technical expertise includes customizing Oracle Application processes to fit the unique needs of our clients in workflow customizations, Oracle Application Framework (OAF), custom forms, and PL/SQL procedures.
